# OCS Sizing Tool

This repository contains another version of a sizing tool.
This tool can be put on a S3 bucket and shared with anyone through the browser.
Currently the backend is based on a JSON file that is generated by a Google Sheet that Kyle Bader controls. The goal is to replace this with a algorithm.

## Access

This repository is private until the answers of this tool have been properly vetted.
An example of this code is hosted in [a S3 bucket](http://rht-sbu.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)
